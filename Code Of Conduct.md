#CODE_OF_CONDUCT



# ==Team Contract==					

 Team: Lises Mermaid

This document describes our team social contract for this project*

Reference [Establishing Norms](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qquhoredhOu-DCmByEU-KDdJXP6XDL962fwYdl_lLaQ/)

# Roles

- **Taskmaster**- checks in with everyone and the status of their tasks. Breaks up those tasks into subtasks, if possible. We should have naming conventions for a task. 
- **Gitmaster-** makes sure everyone is comiting regularly. Perhaps each pair will have a designated gitmaster for the day.
- **Testmaster-** whoever is making a feature, can work on creating a test for that feature

# Daily process

- Morning standup started by yesterday's Taskmaster

- - New roles assigned (by yesterday’s Taskmaster)
  - Yesterday? Today? Obstacles? (by today’s Taskmaster)

- Can switch off every 2 days. 

- Pair program on assigned tasks- Can bring each other up-to-date. Everyone gets to touch. 

- Record issues that are non-blocking and discuss right after lunch at re-group meeting

- Bring up any blocking issues after 15 minutes of spinning your wheels

- At 2:30pm have re-group meeting where you check-in with blockers, status updates and plan for EOD merge (5:15-5:30). Not merge anything that’s finished. But push anything that is pending to their respective branches.

- Immediately prior to end of day make applicable PRs, review each other’s code and merge into master

# Team expectations

- Each of us reserves the rights to our nights and weekends, and we have all been straightforward about when and how we can commit to working on the project. We can stay up to an hour or 2 late. And also attend weekends, depending on the need. If we work want to work solo, we will keep the group updated. 
- If you have a blocking issue, slack before interrupting another’s train of coding-thought
- We will assign tasks vertically (instead of horizontally)
- None of us will specialize in terms of front-end and back-end code
- Don’t interrupt - raise your hand
- Share the mic
- Disagree often and discuss -- argue infrequently
- At least message the group when you change what you are working on

# Issues

- If the group is divided on a certain decision we will take the following steps:

1. Take 10-15 minute break
2. List out the pros / cons
3. Vote on it
4. If the vote is split, escalate to a fellow or instructor

- If you are frustrated

- - Take a walk or get some water
  - Talk constructively about actionable items (e.g. raise your hand instead of interrupting, let me learn and struggle until I ask you for help, etc.)
  - Bring in a 3rd party (e.g. fellow, instructor) to mediate if you feel too frustrated

# ==Establishing Norms==

Each group should discuss and provide an answer for the following questions

- What does this group do when two or more members disagree (ex. on a technical approach, a technology choice, etc)?

- - *Do you vote? Does the whole group get involved? Do you get someone else to decide?*

***`***	**We will vote, and discuss and assess from there. If it gets really bad or we don’t know what the best choice is, we can reach out to the fellows and instructors.**

- What does this group do when a member is frustrated?

- - *What strategy do you use to talk about it? What do you do if you're the frustrated person? What do you do if you're the person someone is frustrated with? Imagine a situation where Person A thinks that Person B is not pulling their weight - write a script for how you think that conversation should go.*

​	**If anyone is frustrated, we encourage people to voice their opinion, so we can mitigate and accommodate. We can involve third party, so they can explain.** 

- What does this group do when we merge our work together?

- - *Do we do it together? Do we require sign off from someone else?*

**Before merging, make sure there is a sign off from someone else. And someone who wasn’t working on it should take a look at it.**

**-Follow consistent commit messages**

**-Don’t make pull requests for non-working code**

- When does this group ask for help?

- - *After 10 minutes? 15? 20? After everybody's tried to solve the problem? What strategies do we use before we ask for help?*

***-Depends on whether conceptual or coding related. We’d ask for help sooner on conceptual questions. Generally, if we are stuck on something, we will ask for group help after 10 minutes, and instructor help after 20 minutes, or whenever we think is appropriate***

***-Strategies: Console.logs, rubber-ducking (each person talking out a problem)***

- How do we pair? What do we do when two group members pair with each other?

- - *Do members of a pair decide their own norms? Do they do things like keep a timer to switch positions? How often do we switch partners?*

***Change pairs every day. We can decide norms together when we pair together, but be in touch about whole picture as a team.***

- How does this group approach work "after hours" (i.e. after normal class hours and weekends)?

- - *Is it okay to work on your own after hours? How do we keep the group informed? Do we only work after hours when we can pair? When the entire group is present?*

**Plan in advance.** 

- What time does this group have daily stand up?

**Every morning**
